# Organization GitHub Repository

This repository supports the YouTube channel [@mapsntimelines](https://www.youtube.com/@mapsntimelines). 

## Overview
This project is all about automating the creation of YouTube Shorts. It takes audio files, puts them into a template, adds text, flags, and other stuff. Itâ€™s still a work in progress (WIP) and might be expanded later.

## Workflow
- Most of the work happens locally, with fewer commits to keep things clean.
- Changes are pushed mainly for backup purposes.

## Features
- **Automatic Shorts Generator**: A tool that handles creating Shorts automatically.
- **YouTube Upload**: Uses the Google Developer Console to upload videos, but there are daily limits to work around.

## Development Notes
- I plan and organize the whole thing with help from ChatGPT for the coding parts.
- I made this project in mid-2024, and have no plans to change it ever again.

## Acknowledgments
- **Planning + Organizing**: Me
- **Coding Syntaxing**: ChatGPT
